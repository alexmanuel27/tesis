  abstract = {The long-term increasing trend of annual mean temperature is only one aspect of recent climate change. Other changes in climate, seen in within-year weather patterns relevant to crop production, have also occurred since the late-19th Century. Multivariate analysis combining Principal Components Analysis and K-means clustering applied to temporal meteorological datasets (monthly summaries of rainfall, temperature and sunlight duration at Rothamsted Research, UK, between 1892 and 2016) identified ten distinct clusters of years, each with different annual weather patterns. The frequency of occurrence of the years within each cluster altered considerably during this period, with the late 20th and early 21st Century distinctly different to earlier in the 20th Century, providing clear evidence of climate change with regard to the whole weather profile rather than just warming alone. The most-frequently represented cluster of the 21st Century to date had warmer temperatures with more intense rainfall but a dry June, compared to all other clusters. Half of the clusters identified were not represented in the most-recent 25-year period. Analysis of the total biomass yield of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and grassland amongst the different weather clusters showed that years in clusters typical of the 20th Century climate provided greater off-take than those from the early-21st Century, but this impact was less for the pasture than for the two cereal crops implying herbage production was the more resilient to the changing climate at this site.},

We concluded that there are countries with high climate and food insecurity risk based on several climate and food security indicators that lack agricultural climate index-based-insurance research that could help farmers in these countries. Research to date has also largely focused on cereal crops and drought, which only represent a fraction of the crops and climate risks that agricultural climate index-based-insurance could be beneficial in managing.

New hydrological insights Based on the trend analysis during the 45-year study period, the reservoir inflows remained higher than the irrigation water demands because of the gradually increasing annual rainfall. Most reservoirs had enough storage capacities; their resilience gradually declined particularly during the last 15 years. The northern and northeastern region reservoirs had acceptable resilience whereas the reservoirs in the western and southwestern inland and coastal regions showed insufficient resilience. Reservoirs received sufficient inflows but the residence time of the excess inflow has to be increased to suffice the peak irrigation demands in the coming cropping season. Study outcomes could help prioritize the reservoirs requiring immediate rehabilitation located in the central and southwest regions with high failure risks. Results suggested that a reservoir with a watershed-irrigated area ratio {$>~$}5 would have a better chance of coping with future climate change threats.},

  abstract = {Africa is highly vulnerable to changes in global climatic conditions due to its low adaptive capacity and sensitivity to changes in climatic variables, particularly in the agricultural sector. A key attribute of studies on climate change coping strategies and adaptation mechanisms in Africa is that they lack local specificity. Within a discourse dominated by large-scale attempts to measure the extent of climate change and its impacts with methods drawn from physical and biological sciences, there is little focus on how locally-specific knowledge and practices help communities to cope with effects of adverse environmental conditions on their agriculture at the farm level. From a sample of 115 respondents drawn from South Africa and Kenya and through interviews, discussions and interactions, this paper demonstrates that local residents deploy their indigenous knowledge in predicting seasonal weather and rainfall patterns, determining wind speed and direction, preserving grains for planting purposes and various traditional farming support systems to lessen the impacts of climate change on their agricultural activities. The paper concludes that merging local knowledge with modern science in Africa could help develop a syncretic agronomical knowledge amongst farmers in handling climate change.},

Deploying Professional Weather Stations (PWS) in vulnerable areas is key for monitoring weather with reliable measurements. However, such professional instrumentation is notably expensive while remote sensing from a number of stations is paramount. This imposes challenges on the large-scale weather station deployment for broad monitoring from large observation networks such as in Cemaden\textemdash The Brazilian National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters. In this context, in this paper, we propose a Low-Cost Automatic Weather Station (LCAWS) system developed from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and open-source Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which provides measurements as reliable as a reference PWS for natural disaster monitoring. When being automatic, LCAWS is a stand-alone photovoltaic system connected wirelessly to the Internet in order to provide real-time reliable end-to-end weather measurements. To achieve data reliability, we propose an intelligent sensor calibration method to correct measures. From a 30-day uninterrupted observation with sampling in minute resolution, we show that the calibrated LCAWS sensors have no statistically significant differences from the PWS measurements. As such, LCAWS has opened opportunities for reducing maintenance costs in Cemaden's observational network.},

  abstract = {In the West African Sahel, climate variability and climate change pose huge challenges to food security and health, particularly for poor and marginalised population groups. Co-production of actionable climate information between scientists and users has been advocated to increase its use in climate change adaptation. Consequently, Weather and Climate Services (WCS) co-production models have been expanding, but there have been few evaluations of their effects. Those that exist mostly focus on the end user. The empirical contribution of this paper is an evidence-based evaluation of the scaling of WCS based on co-production models in Senegal. The methodological contribution is a systemic and iterative evaluation method involving multiple analytical tools. The scaling of WCS in Senegal involved at least 161 actors and resulted in five axes of transformation: 1) continuous improvement of WCS, 2) emergence and consolidation of WCS facilitators, 3) inclusion of WCS in action planning, 4) active mobilisation to sustain WCS scaling, and 5) empowerment of actors. New users and uses emerged beyond agriculture, involving the fisheries, water and energy sectors, producing changes in institutional communication strategies, operational planning, and in coordination between actors. Enabling factors for scaling included capacity strengthening, knowledge-sharing and action platforms, interaction opportunities, and financial and political support. However, reduced precision of forecasts over time is perceived. New challenges are emerging including improving delivery and finer grain information, getting the private sector involved, and building capacity and trust at a large scale, to keep pace with the increase in uses and users},

For these reasons, in this work, the design, construction and fabrication of an adaptable autonomous solar-powered climatic station with wireless 3G or WiFi communication is presented. The station measures relative humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and light radiation. In addition, the system monitors the charge state of the main battery and the energy generated by the photovoltaic module to act as a reference cell for solar energy generation capability and agrivoltaic potential in the installation area. The station can be remotely controlled and reconfigured. The collected data from all sensors can be uploaded to the cloud in real-time.

  abstract = {CONTEXT Climate change and variability have been identified as major threats to key sectors such as agriculture that drive economic growth and sustainable development in developing countries. The provision of tailored weather and climate information services (WCIS) that meet users' expectations can play an important role in helping decision makers adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change and climate However, the evidence base showing the benefits of WCIS is still thin. OBJECTIVE This study analyzes the impact of uptake of tailored seasonal and daily weather forecasts that are mediated by a multidisciplinary working group (MWG) on crop productivity and household income of smallholder farmers in Senegal. METHODS A two-season balanced dataset in combination with panel econometrics was used to explore the impact of uptake of weather and climate information on crop income for farmers in Senegal. The data were complemented by participatory surveys that provide richer contextual information to explain the causal pathways that link farmers' uptake with increased crop income for farmers with access to the MWG. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Results show that the use of weather and climate information increased the value of crop produce by between 10 and 25\% for farmers with access to an MWG. Coordinated platforms that involve diverse stakeholders like the MWGs play a critical role in co-producing weather and climate information that are more usable to farmers, thereby improving uptake and livelihoods. The impact pathways and implications for policy are discussed. SIGNIFICANCE This study expands the limited evidence base on the role of weather and climate services in improving the livelihoods of smallholder by (i) going beyond the use of cross-sectional and using longitudinal data, (ii) analyzing causal impacts on farmer's livelihoods, i.e., crop yields and household income and (iii) using participatory approaches to better explain the causal impact pathways.},

  abstract = {How to cope with climate variability and adapt to climate change are key challenges for smallholder farmers globally. In low-income countries, farmers have typically received little, if any locally relevant weather or climate information. Although climate services have contributed to increased availability and accessibility of climate information, this has rarely achieved the desired impacts for farmers' decision-making, adaptation and resilience to climate variability and change. This has been attributed to a lack of engagement with intended users of climate information and a top-down approach to development and delivery of climate services that fails to adequately consider and account for farmers' context-specific requirements. Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) is an approach that was developed to support and empower farmers in their decision-making processes. More than 200,000 farmers have been trained in 23 countries and this paper presents evidence from evaluations in 7 countries including that most (87\%; n~=~4,299) have made beneficial changes in their crops, livestock and/or livelihood enterprises. The approach has strengthened key institutions that support farmers through deliberative scoping, tailoring, and capacity-building activities with extension and meteorological services. It has been well received by those that use it and is being integrated into policy and training curricula. Key reasons for the success of the approach include the importance of supporting farmers as decision makers and empowering them to relate relatively complex weather and climate information to their own contexts. Key considerations for the future include ensuring sustainability and further scaling as well as maintaining quality.},

At present, however, there is little guidance on the impact of the use of WCIS on the adoption of CSA practices. This study examines this nexus by focusing on mobile phone delivery channels of weather forecasts through the ESOKO platform in the Upper West Region of Ghana. We employ a simultaneous equation system with a recursive bivariate probit model in which both the outcome (CSA practices) and the endogenous treatment variable (WCIS) are binary. We found the use of WCIS is endogenously treated to farmers in the adoption models of pest-resistant crops, water management, and multiple cropping practices. The use of WCIS significantly increases the adoption of water management and multiple cropping practices by 6.8\% and 5.6\% respectively. We found, however, no statistical significance on the effects of WCIS on the adoption rates of erosion control, pest-resistant crops, and integrated pest management. Our findings underscore the importance of the source of information on agricultural practices (e.g. radio, TV), farmers' characteristics (e.g. gender, age) and their perceptions of climate change in the decision to use WCIS. Pathways for promoting CSA practices should address the adoption barriers inherent to farmers' characteristics and their livelihood strategies (e.g. livestock, income diversification).},

One of the main implementation challenges in these countries is the lack of reliable weather data for index development and implementation. The increasing availability of satellite data could ease the constraints of data access. Meanwhile, the suitability of various satellite products for yield estimation across world regions has to undergo a thorough assessment. This study contributes to the literature by systematically analyzing the accuracy of some globally available satellite data, namely the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) compared to ground-level weather information for 14 different indicators for the case of Uzbekistan. Our analysis indicates that those sources may provide the necessary data for an accessible and adequate climate service. However, a considerable risk of overestimation and underestimation depending on the source of satellite data may exist, especially for precipitation data in the conditions of Central Asia. Among the tested datasets, GSMaP showed a relatively better performance than CHIRPS in precipitation estimation for drought and flood detection. In order to reduce detection inaccuracy, the application of satellite weather products for index insurance is possible when temporal aggregation (e.g., monthly, seasonal) is considered. Globally available climate data could serve as a good source to establish index insurance products in Central Asia; however, a careful selection of source and index is required.},

In addition, accounting for spatial and temporal spillovers exacerbates and attenuates wet day cumulative effect, respectively, and local crop production is affected by neighboring countries' production. The results are robust to several sensitivity checks, including accounting for adaptation using long-term averages, and are consistent across country-income groups.

In a speculative feminist framework, earth images may transcend their dominant roles as scientific tools and cultural allegories and become tactical devices for imagining and acting otherwise. To illustrate this, we draw empirically from the work of the feminist artistic project open-weather to make three propositions: first, envisioning a fractal earth; second, writing experience into remotely-sensed images; and third, recording the more-than-meteorological weather. Images and imaginaries of earth are not only co-constitutive of the material conditions and worlds that produce them; in a speculative feminist framework, these images and imaginaries are also accountable to these worlds.},

  abstract = {Over 90\% of Swedish agriculture is rainfed, and thus future climate change can pose a risk to agricultural production in coming decades. An overall increase in annual precipitation is predicted for northern Europe, but Sweden could still face an increasing need for irrigation, as shown by the drought summer of 2018. Adaptation of Swedish agriculture to include irrigated agriculture should thus be considered. To evaluate the theoretical need for irrigation, calculations were performed for different locations in Sweden, and for different soil-crop pairs at each location. In-situ weather data from a projected climate dataset created by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute were used to evaluate changes in irrigation need over the period 1981\textendash 2050. The results showed an increasing need for irrigation of cereal crops during the early season (May\textendash June), for two main reasons: i) A shift to an earlier start of the cropping period, leading to an earlier need for irrigation; and ii) a higher probability of dry spring weather, substantially increasing the irrigation requirement in dry years. Crops for which the growing season starts later (e.g., potatoes) showed an increasing need for irrigation during July. Crop development stages were predicted to occur earlier, leading to earlier harvesting, reducing the irrigation requirement in August. However, the calculation approach developed for this study may have underestimated the need for irrigation, which could be higher than reported here.},

  abstract = {Climate change has had a significant impact on global agricultural production. Hence, studying the impact of climate change on the efficiency of agricultural production has become crucial in helping major agricultural regions around the world adopt novel technologies to improve the adaptability of agricultural production. The efficiency of agricultural production can also be improved, and global food safety can be ensured at the same time. This paper used data collected from 43 countries around the world from 1992 to 2018. The data envelopment analysis-Malmquist model was used to estimate agricultural productivity with and without the presence of climate factors, and data comparison and analysis were performed among years and regions. The results show that climate factors can overestimate agricultural productivity. On the whole, climate factors have a positive impact on agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and a negative impact in other areas. In addition, the impact of climate change on technical progress is greater than the impact on technical efficiency. According to the results, this paper finds that relevant departments should pay attention to the development of agricultural technology under climate change and should carry out suitable management based on geographical location and climate conditions. In summary, the research methods and results of this article provide a reference for the progress of agricultural production under global climate change.},

This paper analyses the overall role of these forces and population growth in redefining global food security. Specifically, global water supply and demand as well as the linkages between water supply and food security are examined. The analysis reveals that the water for food security situation is intricate and might get daunting if no action is taken. Investments are needed today for enhancing future food security; this requires action on several fronts, including tackling climate change, preserving land and conserving water, reducing the energy footprint in food systems, developing and adopting climate resilient varieties, modernising irrigation infrastructure, shoring up domestic food supplies, reforming international food trade, and responding to other global challenges.},

  abstract = {A good understanding of mineral evolution and soil properties in the context of agricultural activities is important for soil utilization and management. To investigate the effect various forms of intensive agriculture in different climate regions on the evolution of phyllosilicate minerals and iron (hydr)oxides, three zonal soils were studied under various long-term agriculture with different fertilizers and using fallow soil as reference state. The phyllosilicate composition and Fe species of the clay fractions ({$<$}2~{$\mu$}m) were determined, and the detailed mineralogical differences together with selected soil specific properties were analyzed. The results were used to unravel the most likely reasons for the distinctive mineral weathering differences caused by the different conditions. The variation of the extent of mineral weathering of the soils was mainly controlled by climate conditions. The relatively arid climate restrained the chemical weathering in Orthic Entisols. In subtropic humid area, intensive agriculture promoted the decilication of Udic Ferrisols, resulting in a slignt increase in kaolinite content by {$<$}5\%. However, in the temperate humid area the phyllosilicate mineral assemblage of Udic Isohumosols was sensitive to tillage and fertilization practices. This was mainly reflected by the mutual transformation between non-expandable illite and expandable vermiculite or smectite depending on the variation of K pool. This conclusion was supported by the significant positive correlations between illite and available K (P~=~0.005) and between illite and slow-available K (P~=~0.047). Compared with phyllosilicate minerals, the iron species and crystallinity indicated by Feo/Fed ratio were more susceptible to intensive agriculture. This could be inferred from the one order of magnitude larger variation coefficients of the Feo/Fed ratio in the three soils under different agriculture/fertilization than the variation of the Fed/Fet ratio. The key factor affecting the Feo/Fed ratio was the OC/Fed molar ratio. Highest values of the Feo/Fed ratio and its variation coefficients in Udic Isohumosols also illustrated that iron (hydr)oxides were more vulnerable to agricultural activities in the temperate monsoon climate region. It can conclude that it is necessary to manage the agricultural utilization of arable soils in temperate humid areas with more by specifically regarding the K and OC content for a good soil quality.},

Emissions from the agriculture sector (e.g. GHG emissions, and release of pesticides, herbicides, and nutrients) is causing global warming as well as damaging the environment, and in return climate change is stressing agriculture globally. The bewildering relationship between adaptative measures and risk of maladaptive outcomes demands a better understanding concerning ``What, where and how to implement'' adaptive measures. This article is one step towards a deeper understanding of ``what'', ``where'' and ``how'' related questions on climate change adaptation in connection to constraints of carrying capacities and risks of maladaptation. A GIS based framework was employed for generating risk maps for identification of nutrient surplus and discharge hotspots ``i.e. Where to implement?''. Moreover, extensive in-depth interviews and a questionnaire survey were conducted to explore perceptions on carrying capacities, resources management, climate change adaptation measures and risk of maladaptive results, i.e. ``What and how to implement?''. Furthermore, the data collected from the questionnaire survey and interviews was employed to ameliorate the analytical model, previously developed, based on the initial work of Juhola et al. (2016) and Neset et al. (2019a), which could help guide planners, advisors, and farmers for better understanding of adaptation and maladaptive risks. The study is expected to assist in developing robust, sustainable and climate smart adaptive interventions in response to negative climate change impacts.},

It is of great significance to explore the response characteristics of crop water footprint (WF) in rain-fed and irrigation agriculture to climate change for guiding agricultural production. This study coupled and downscaled the meteorological data from 31 global climate models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) in China, and used crop growth model AquaCrop in large scale to quantify the changes in yield and WF of maize in China from the 2030s to the 2090s. The Monte Carlo Method was used to calibrate the crop parameters in AquaCrop model, which improved the accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of the crop model. Results showed that precipitation and temperature would increase in most regions in China, which was more obvious in the RCP8.5 scenario. Meanwhile, climate change resulted in larger crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for maize in the north than south. In the future, the increase of ETc in Southwest China would be relatively larger, while that in Northwest China would decrease. Maize yield would generally increase in most regions except for central China, where illustrated that increases in the north was greater than in the south. In terms of irrigation strategies, full irrigation could mitigate the reduction in maize yield caused by climate change. However, increasing irrigation would have fewer benefits to maize yield in humid regions compared with arid and semiarid regions in China. In addition, increasing irrigation could not greatly reduce the WF of maize in humid regions. Due to different climatic and hydraulic soil characteristics in each region, the effects of climate change and irrigation strategies on WF of maize would vary in different regions. This study provided irrigation strategies guidance to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on agricultural production and its water use.},

To this end, a national-scale service operated by centralized governments will mandate institutional coordination for data sharing, in addition to designated staff time and budget commitments for effective and sustainable operation; however, previous efforts have revealed that institutional coordination, particularly between meteorology and agriculture, represents the most difficult part preventing successful implementation in most countries. In this study, we examined the use of a top-down, information and communication technology (ICT)-based multidisciplinary platform for agrometeorological services for facilitating institutional coordination and ensuring project sustainability. The Strengthening Agro-climatic Monitoring and Information Systems (SAMIS) project, operational since 2018, focuses on building the adaptive capacity of agrometeorological services in Laos by combining the agricultural and meteorological sectors. The research here utilized the ICT-based service platform Laos Climate Services for Agriculture (LaCSA) to systematically engage relevant institutional partners in the co-creation process of agrometeorological services. The results showed that LaCSA enabled co-creation, including data sharing, collaborative tool use, institutional coordination, and policy support from multiple government entities across the agricultural and meteorological sectors. Key lessons and suggestions included co-training for both sectors, easy-to-use data management processes, early buy-in for policy makers, and creating standard operating procedures designating staff time and budgets. These results indicate that the coordinated operation of agrometeorological services through an ICT-based service platform can be successfully achieved in Laos as well as other developing countries, where institutional disconnects and human capital constraints hinder successful implementation of agrometeorological services.},

Darab region in southeastern Iran, which is a hub of agricultural and horticultural production, has only one synoptic station despite its diverse climatic conditions. So, the study's purpose is to determine microclimates, the number of meteorological stations necessary, and the types of plants suitable for cultivation based on landforms, altitudes, and temperatures. The temperature zoning maps were prepared by the IDW method (meteorological stations near the study area) and MODIS satellite image for every month for an average of 15~years (2004\textendash 2019). In order to determine the relationship between temperature classes and topographic features, the digital elevation model and topographic position index (TPI) were used, respectively. For each microclimate in the study area, different types of tropical, subtropical, and temperate tree cultivars were determined. According to the results, there are six microclimates in the study area. Correlation results between topography, rainfall and temperature indicate that there is a strong link (R2~=~0.91) between these variables. From these values, 6 classes with 6 microclimates can be determined for the study area, which indicates that 6 meteorological stations are needed. In order to increase productivity, one of the major innovations of this study focused on the relationship between the type of landforms in the region and the type of vegetation. The results showed that canyons, shallow valleys, plains small, open slopes, upper slopes, hills in valleys, and mid-slope ridges are suitable for growing tropical plants; canyons, u-shaped valleys, hills in valleys, and mid-slope ridges are suitable for cultivation of subtropical plants; and upland drainages, canyons, upper slopes, mid-slope ridges, and mountain tops are suitable for cultivation of temperate plants.},

Although there are numerous studies that estimate the global impact of climate change, country-level studies are still rare, particularly as far as Italy is concerned. By exploiting a panel of 110 provinces observed between 1980 and 2014, this paper investigates the impact of variation of weather variables on GDP per capita and agricultural productivity in Italy. To address issues of model uncertainty, the analysis explores to what extent these economic outcomes are affected by weather variables, linearly or non-linearly, as well as how their growth rate and levels are affected as a result. Main findings show that there is considerable model uncertainty. The most robust econometric results showing statistically significant effects of temperature for both the GDP and agricultural reaction function are from a levels specification, where temperature is included in a non-linear form while weather variables and economic outcomes enter in first differences. Projections of the impact of climate change by the end of the century show slight average effects for GDP per-capita, but important losses in agriculture, due to a persistent increase in average temperatures under both the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5.},

Measuring the amount of precipitation at a given location using surface instruments is relatively simple. However, the great spatial and temporal variability of the intensity, type and occurrence of this phenomenon, makes direct and uniformly calibrated measurements difficult in large regions. Satellite information is an important alternative to describe precipitation events; the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission estimates precipitation, considering different time periods, with three products Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), in near real time. This study evaluates and quantifies, temporal and spatially, the monthly precipitation estimated by Early (IMERG-E), Late (IMERG-L) and Final (IMERG-F) products compared with data from weather stations located in agricultural areas of the Pampas region in Argentina. Data of precipitation belonging to meteorological stations located at four provinces: Buenos Aires, C\'ordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe, for 2014\textendash 2018 periods, were considered. The spatial performance of IMERG was evaluated using statistical coefficients and Taylor diagrams, considering at region, province and stations level. The adjustment of the products increased from IMERG-E to IMERG\textendash F, obtaining R2 values between 0.86 and 0.95 and RMSE from 14.2 to 29.3~mm, the best results corresponding to C\'ordoba and the worst to La Pampa. The performance of GPM products varies temporally; IMERG-F presented a higher correlation coefficient and a lower percent root mean square error in warm than in cold seasons. The results indicate that GPM can effectively capture the amount and patterns of monthly precipitation over the Pampas region of Argentina, which is important for its application to agricultural production and disaster prevention.},

The station is made up of an Arduino Yun, which is in charge of monitoring the climatic variation through its analog, digital and I2C communication inputs, getting the different values of humidity sensors, temperature, wind speed (anemometer), wind direction, rain gauge and solar irradiation. On the other hand, to fulfill the functions of a server a Raspberry Pi with its Raspbian operating system is incorporated, where by programming in Java, which contains libraries of the MQTT, stores the variables in a database MySql. The database is used as a link between the sensors and the WEB server. This server was executed on the Raspberry Pi, using Apache Tomcat, which is used as a proxy server. This fact allows access to resources, routing all traffic (searching on the WEB) to the server, due to the need that the application and the Web page should be shown outside the private network. The Web page generation was done through the WEB Ratio program, which is updated in real time on a regular basis and they are shown by tables and graphs on the WEB page: emeteo.ddns.net. Through a dynamic DNS server, with free access, this allows us to associate our IP address with a domain name for the WEB page. Finally, in order to establish that the data from the meteorological station transmits in MODBUS, the Nod-Red graphic tool was used, which is installed within the Raspbian operating system. This is responsible for converting the MQTT to MODBUS. To verify the correct function of this, a ModbusSlave simulator was used, as well as a test SCADA called SCADALaquis, showing in a graphical way the data of the station, also allowing the requirement of the historical data.},

To obtain reliable estimates of the moment-based production function, the unit root tests and feasible generalized least squares involving a panel data model are explored using economic crop production and weather data from the provincial level from 1989 to 2017. The findings revealed that the primary weather variables (temperature and rainfall) have a significant impact on crop production. This study proposed weather index insurance as an institutional safeguard against the risk of reduced crop production due to climate change for 2030 2060 and 2090. According to the weather index insurance design, the insurance schemes have a risk reduction performance of 8.14 and 13.37 percent for rice, 2.43 and 6.48 percent for oil palm, and 8.89 and 14.13 percent for rubber tree, respectively. Weather index insurance is a guideline that farmers can use to mitigate the adverse effects of future climate change on economic crop production. The main contribution of this study is the proposal of an insurance scheme and the investigation of whether this measurement can effectively protect crop production losses due to climate change scenarios. However, weather index insurance continues to face persistent social inclusion and sustainable development challenges, which have an impact on the overall effectiveness of insurance schemes.},

The spatiotemporal changes of wheat phenology had been investigated before, nevertheless some key scientific questions remain inconclusive. Here, the updated phenological observations with the longest time period (1981\textendash 2018) and the largest number of records (7,659 records at 357 stations) for wheat in China were applied to investigate whether the response of wheat phenology to recent climate warming declined, how wheat responded to asymmetric warming, and how different drivers affected wheat phenology change. The results showed wheat sowing date delayed but heading and maturity date advanced generally during 1981\textendash 2018. Trends in wheat sowing date, heading date, maturity date, vegetative growing period (VGP), reproductive growing period (RGP) and whole growing period (GP) between 1981\textendash 1999 and 2000\textendash 2018 changed heterogeneously across the agro-ecological zones. This inconsistence may be ascribed to the compound impacts of climate change and agricultural managements such as cultivar shifts. Climate warming impacts on GP increased for winter wheat but declined for spring wheat in most regions from 1981\textendash 1999 to 2000\textendash 2018. Daily minimum temperature increased more than mean and maximum temperature, however VGP, RGP and GP were more sensitive to mean and maximum temperature than to minimum temperature. Maximum and minimum temperature had contrasting effects. Spring wheat was more sensitive to temperature than winter wheat, and RGP was more sensitive to temperature than VGP and GP because the later was also subject to photoperiod and vernalization. During 1981\textendash 2018, climate warming shortened GP on average by 4.2 and 4.6 days/decade for winter and spring wheat, respectively. Cultivar shifts prolonged it by 2.0 and 2.9 days/decade, respectively. Changes in sowing date shortened it on average by 0.5 and 0.4 days/decade, respectively. The effects of other factors such as fertilization and irrigation changed it on average by 0.1 and -0.3 days/decade, respectively. And the effects of all agricultural managements together prolonged it on average by 1.6 and 2.4 days/decade, respectively. Our findings provide new insights into the spatiotemporal changes of wheat phenology, as well as their drivers, across China in the past four decades.},

  abstract = {The occurrence of major wildfires in countries such as Portugal, Italy and Spain (2017) and Sweden (2018) indicated that wildfires pose a risk across Europe. While Central Europe has not been at the center of such events, observed climate data and climate projections suggest a tendency toward more years with wet and warm winters and dry and hot summers as well as fuel accumulation, leading to more hazardous conditions. Although some existing studies analyzed the differences in wildfire occurrence in this territory based on terrain, soil or vegetation characteristics, the effects of climate change have not been properly appraised. To fill this knowledge gap, we used and tested an ensemble of nine fuel aridity metrics, including three dedicated fire danger rating indices, and evaluated their level of agreement with actual fire occurrence, their ability to explain the interannual variability in wildfire frequency, and their temporal trends. The analysis covered the entire territory of the Czech Republic at 500 m spatial resolution. Two periods were included based on observed (1956\textendash 2015) and projected (2020\textendash 2100) meteorological data using ensembles of five regional climate models (RCMs) and five global circulation models (GCMs) based on Euro-CORDEX and CMIP5 datasets. For the future, we considered Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5. Our results showed that since 1956, most of the Czech territory has exhibited an increasing frequency of fire weather days (i.e., days with highly conducive wildfire conditions) and an increasing area affected by weather conducive to wildfire occurrence, with the trends accelerating after 2000. The annual variation in the fuel aridity levels (derived solely from meteorological data) explained more than 2/3 of the reported wildfire variability during 1991\textendash 2015 over the Czech Republic. The future projections based on the RCM or GCM ensembles indicated a significant increase in fuel aridity and an increase in the area under fire-conducive conditions. Recommendations derived from such robust results are provided for stakeholders seeking to implement adaptation measures.},

  abstract = {Global climate change is manifest by local-scale changes in precipitation and temperature patterns, including the frequency of extreme weather events (EWEs). EWEs are associated with a myriad range of adverse environmental and societal consequences, including negative impacts to agriculture and food production. This study focuses on EWEs and their effect on adaptation strategies by potato and onion farmers in Zeeland, a Dutch coastal province in the Rhine delta that can serve as a model for other intensive agricultural landscapes in industrialized nations impacted by extreme weather events. The research approach combines quantitative trend analysis of long-term climatic data (temperature, precipitation) with a formal survey of Zeelandic farmers to statistically test four specific hypotheses regarding the frequency of EWEs in the Netherlands and farmer awareness and adaptation. Trend analyses reveal a strong (statistically significant) increase in extreme heat, a small increase in extreme rainfall and drought, and a strong decrease in frost occurrence. Survey results indicate Zeelandic farmers perceive high risk and awareness of changes to the frequency of EWEs. Many farmers have experienced financial losses from EWEs, particularly between 2017 and 2020. For extreme heat, droughts, and frost, the proportion of farmers that incurred financial damages annually is statistically correlated to the actual occurrence of EWEs. Farmers who incurred more financial losses between 2000 and 2020 due to heat and lack of frost had a higher risk perception of these extremes. Further, almost all farmers have already implemented one or more adaptation strategies. A third of surveyed farmers reduced or stopped with potato and onion cultivation in response to climate change and EWEs. Awareness, exposure to, and risk perception of EWEs contribute to adaptation support by farmers. The high perceived risk of climate change and EWEs among respondents and the high incidence of financial losses from extremes in the past two decades highlights the importance of adaptation in the agricultural sector, including in temperate regions where growing seasons are expanding. Study results support the current `Rural Development Program' and future `National Strategic Plan' policies in the Netherlands, both part of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), that provides accessibility to adaptation measures for farmers to avoid financial loss.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT Climate change continues to affect maize production, food security and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in most of the developing countries. Climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices can enhance agricultural production by alleviating adverse climate effects on maize productivity through improved soil moisture storage, water use efficiency, increased soil carbon (C) and nutrient supply with long-term resilience to climate change. OBJECTIVE This study investigated the effectiveness of CSA practices (mulching at 0, 2, 4 and 6~cm thicknesses), permanent planting basins (20 and 30~cm deep), and halfmoon pits as a mitigation and adaptation strategy for improving maize productivity in rainfed production systems in the sub-humid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS We used the AquaCrop model of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2018), AquaCrop version 6.1 to evaluate potential benefits of the CSA practices: half-moon, mulching (using different thickness) and permanent planting basins compared to a control treatment in rainfed production systems. The performance of CSA practices was evaluated using field experiments under present and future conditions. We first parameterized the model based on a three-season field experiment (2019-2020). We then run the model under projected future trends (2010\textendash 2039) using four general circulation models in each two greenhouse gas (GHG) emission representation concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5). Finally, we evaluated resulting maize growth, grain yield, and water use efficiency for all the treatments. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Our results indicated that use of mulching, especially 6~cm thick mulch increased maize grain yield and water use efficiency under present and future conditions. It was noted that CSA practices would increase grain yield by 14\textendash 37\% under RCP8.5 climate scenario. Projections revealed increases in mean temperature of 0.5~\textdegree C and 1.0~\textdegree C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, in the 30~years (2010\textendash 2039). The model also projected a decrease (4.7\%) and increase (2\%) of the annual averages of rainfall in the future under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. SIGNIFICANCE Our findings highlight the key role of CSA practices in reducing the climate change effects on maize production in the sub-humid regions. Therefore, national governments should prioritize adoption of climate smart agriculture practices as a key strategy for improving and sustaining maize productivity in rainfed systems of the sub-humid region.},
